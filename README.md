# Identicon

This is an app which creates an identicon for the user.

An identicon is a icon used by places such as github to create a default image for users who have not set a profile picture.

Identicons are not randomly generated, each individual identicon should be associated with a specific 'user' or person. 

This code was created by following a course by Stephen Grider on the basics of Elixir.
